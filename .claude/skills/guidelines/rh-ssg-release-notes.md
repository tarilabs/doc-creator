description: Review Red Hat release notes for SSG compliance — tense rules (present default, past for "before this update"), informative headings (sentence case, no gerunds, under 120 chars), Jira references on known/fixed issues, AsciiDoc formatting (description lists, + attachment), and release note types: new features, enhancements, rebases (X.Y.Z format), Technology Preview entries, deprecated features, removed features, known issues (Cause > Consequence > Workaround > Result), and fixed issues (CCFR pattern). Use this skill whenever reviewing, writing, or checking release notes for any Red Hat product.

# Red Hat SSG: Release Notes review skill

Review release notes for compliance with the Red Hat Supplementary Style Guide.

## Checklist

### General style

- Focus on impact to the user; omit overly technical details
- Avoid passive voice, modal verbs, and ambiguous language ("Should XY happen" > "If XY happens")
- No infinitive statements from changelogs ("Remove deprecated macros" > "Deprecated macros are removed")
- Unfamiliar terms (utilities, packages, commands) are defined on first mention outside headings
- Abbreviations are expanded in descriptions (not in headings)
- Sentences do not start with a lowercase word — repeat the definition if needed
- Admonitions are minimal; release notes do not begin with admonitions

### Tenses

- Simple present tense is the default
- No future tenses, "should," or "might" for post-update state
- Simple past tense describes the situation before the current update
- "Now" is not used to refer to the post-update state
- Fixed issues follow CCFR tense logic (Cause-Consequence-Fix-Result)
- "Before this update" is used instead of "previously"

### Headings

- Each release note has an informative heading summarizing the note
- Headings use sentence-style capitalization (not title case)
- Headings are under 120 characters
- Headings do not start with a gerund (release note headings should be descriptive, not task-oriented)
- Headings mention the component when it might not be obvious
- Headings are specific, not overly generic ("Program no longer crashes" is too vague)
- Abbreviations in headings are not expanded (expanded in the text below)

### Jira references

- All Known issues and Fixed issues include Jira ticket references
- Jira references are on the line directly after the entry (not in parentheses or brackets)
- If tickets require login, introductory text states: "Some linked Jira tickets are accessible only with Red Hat credentials."

### AsciiDoc formatting

- Each release note is a description list item (not nested headings)
- Additional paragraphs after the first line are attached with `+` on a separate line
- Lists within a release note are attached with `+`, and a `+` follows the list before the next paragraph
- Open blocks (`--`) are attached with `+` before and after

### New features and enhancements

- Describes **what** the feature/enhancement is, **why** it benefits the customer, and the **result**
- Links to product documentation if available
- When TP becomes fully supported, this is clearly stated

### Rebases

- Version uses X.Y.Z format only (not `+1-A.elN`)
- Includes a parallel list of highlights
- No blank rebase descriptions — include details if the component is important
- Zeroth minor versions (e.g., 10.0): "provided in version X.Y.Z" not "rebased to"

### Technology Preview features

- Heading ends with "(Technology Preview)"
- Description mentions the feature is a Technology Preview
- Technology Preview admonition is NOT used in release notes (would be repetitive)
- TP release notes are repeated in subsequent releases until GA or removal

### Deprecated features

- Describes the feature, states it is deprecated, and provides the alternative
- Does not use "Recommended" — per SSG glossary
- Does not repeat the definition of "deprecated" from the section intro
- Does not predict future feature statuses: "will be deprecated next release"

### Removed features

- Feature was documented as deprecated in a preceding release
- Describes the feature, states it is removed, and provides the alternative
- Small part removals are treated as feature changes, not removed features

### Known issues

- Follows: Cause > Consequence > Workaround > Result structure
- Workaround is in a separate paragraph: "To work around this problem, ..."
- If no workaround exists: "No known workaround exists."
- Uses present tense
- Never promises future fixes

### Fixed issues (bug fixes)

- Follows CCFR: "Before this update, <cause>. As a consequence, <consequence>. With this release, <fix>. As a result, <result>."
- Cause and consequence in past tense; fix and result in present tense
- Uses "before this update" not "previously"

## How to use

1. Review only changed content and necessary context
2. For each issue found, cite the relevant SSG section and release note type
3. Mark issues as **required** (wrong tense, missing Jira reference, missing heading) or **[SUGGESTION]** (style improvements)

## Example invocations

- "Review these release notes for SSG compliance"
- "Check the known issues section in release-notes.adoc"
- "Do an SSG release notes review on the 4.17 release notes"
