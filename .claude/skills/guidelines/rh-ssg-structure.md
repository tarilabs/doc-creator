description: Review Red Hat documentation for SSG structural compliance — admonitions (NOTE/IMPORTANT/WARNING/TIP only, no CAUTION, no clustering, modules never start with admonitions), lead-in sentences (only when needed after Prerequisites/Procedure headings), prerequisites (written as completed states not imperative commands), and short descriptions/abstracts (2-3 sentences, customer-centric, no self-referential language). Use this skill when checking Red Hat docs for admonition usage, prerequisite formatting, short descriptions, or structural compliance. Takes precedence over ibm-sg-structure-and-format for Red Hat content.

# Red Hat SSG: Structure review skill

Review documentation for structural compliance with the Red Hat Supplementary Style Guide.

## Checklist

### Admonitions

- Admonitions are kept to a minimum; no multiple admonitions clustered together
- Only valid types are used: NOTE, IMPORTANT, WARNING, TIP
- CAUTION admonition is not used (not supported by Red Hat Customer Portal)
- Admonitions are short and concise — no procedures inside admonitions
- Only singular admonition headings ("NOTE" not "NOTES")
- Modules do not start with an admonition — a short description must come first

### Lead-in sentences

- No unnecessary lead-in sentences after "Prerequisites" or "Procedure" headings
- Lead-in sentences are used only when needed for navigation or clarity (e.g., grouping long prerequisite lists, emphasizing all steps must be completed)
- Lead-in sentences are complete sentences (not fragments)

### Prerequisites

- Prerequisites are written as checks or completed states, not imperative commands
- Passive voice is acceptable when the agent is unknown or unimportant: "JDK 11 or later is installed"
- Imperative formations are avoided: not "Install JDK 11" but "JDK 11 or later is installed"
- Parallel language is used across all prerequisite bullets

### Short descriptions

- Every module and assembly has a short description (abstract) before the main content
- Short descriptions are 2–3 sentences
- Short descriptions include **what** users must do and **why** they must do it
- Product name appears in either the title or short description
- No self-referential language: not "This topic covers..." or "Use this procedure to..."
- No feature-focused language: not "This product allows you to..."
- Customer-centric language is used: "You can... by..." or "To..., configure..."
- Active voice and present tense are used

## How to use

1. Review only changed content and necessary context
2. For each issue found, cite the relevant SSG section
3. Mark issues as **required** (missing short description, CAUTION admonition used, imperative prerequisites) or **[SUGGESTION]** (improvements)

## Example invocations

- "Review structure in this procedure module"
- "Check admonitions and prerequisites in proc_configuring-auth.adoc"
- "Do an SSG structure review on the changed modules"
