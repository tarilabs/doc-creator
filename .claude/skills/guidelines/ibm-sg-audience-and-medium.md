description: Review documentation for IBM Style Guide audience and medium issues — accessibility (alt text, color, headings), global audience readiness (idioms, date formats, cultural references), tone (active voice, no "please" or "simply"), AI assistant style, marketing claims, and mobile/video content. Use this skill when reviewing docs for accessibility, internationalization, tone problems, or audience appropriateness. For Red Hat docs, prefer the rh-ssg-accessibility skill for accessibility-specific checks.

# IBM Style Guide: Audience and Medium review skill

Review documentation for audience and medium issues: accessibility, global audiences, tone, AI assistant style, mobile, marketing, and video content.

**Precedence**: For Red Hat documentation, the Red Hat Supplementary Style Guide (SSG) takes precedence over IBM Style Guide rules. Where guidance conflicts, follow the RH SSG skill for that topic (e.g., `rh-ssg-accessibility` for accessibility).

## Checklist

### Accessibility

- Every image has alt text that describes function, not appearance
- Color is not the sole means of conveying meaning
- Link text is descriptive (no "click here" or "see below")
- Headings use semantic levels in order (H1 > H2 > H3); no skipped levels
- Directional language is avoided ("the panel on the right"); use labels or names
- Text equivalents are provided for video and audio content
- Tables are used for data only, not for layout; header rows and captions are present

### Global audiences

- Idioms, slang, colloquialisms, and culture-specific references are avoided
- Sentence structures are simple: subject-verb-object
- Humor, puns, and wordplay are avoided
- Latin abbreviations (e.g., i.e., etc.) are written out ("for example," "that is," "and so on")
- Phrasal verbs are replaced with single-word alternatives ("remove" not "take out")
- Date formats are unambiguous (1 January 2025, not 1/1/25)
- Country-specific examples include context for international readers
- "Domestic," "foreign," "overseas" are replaced with specific country or region names

### Tone

- Active voice and present tense are used as defaults
- The reader is addressed as "you"
- "Please" is not used in instructions
- "Simply," "just," "easy," "straightforward" are not used
- Content states what to do, not what not to do
- Hedging is avoided ("You might want to consider possibly...")

### AI assistant and conversational style

- "I" is used for the assistant and "you" for the user
- Responses lead with the answer, then explain
- Filler phrases are avoided ("I think," "It seems like," "I'm happy to help")
- The AI is not anthropomorphized (no feelings, opinions, or consciousness claims)
- Errors are acknowledged plainly, not with casual language ("Oops!")

### Marketing content

- Superlatives are avoided ("best," "fastest") unless backed by evidence
- No unsubstantiated claims or guarantees
- Competitive comparisons do not disparage competitors
- Concrete benefits are used over vague buzzwords

### Mobile

- Content is concise for small screens
- Important information is front-loaded in headings and paragraphs
- "Tap" is used instead of "click" for mobile interfaces

### Videos

- Scripts use a conversational, spoken style with short sentences
- Closed captions and transcripts are provided
- Visuals are introduced before being shown

## How to use

1. Review only changed content and necessary context
2. For each issue found, cite the relevant IBM Style Guide section
3. Mark issues as **required** (accessibility violations, misleading tone) or **[SUGGESTION]** (style improvements)

## Example invocations

- "Review this file for audience and accessibility issues"
