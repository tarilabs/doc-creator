description: Review documentation for IBM Style Guide technical elements — code examples (language tags, realistic values, RFC 2606/5737 addresses), command-line formatting (prompts, line continuation), command syntax notation (<variable>, [optional], {choice1|choice2}), file names/paths (monospace), keyboard keys (bold, Ctrl+C), menus (bold, File > Save), UI elements (bold, correct interaction verbs: click/select/enter/clear), and web/IP/email addresses. Use this skill when checking code blocks, CLI examples, UI element formatting, keyboard shortcuts, or command syntax in docs. For Red Hat docs, rh-ssg-technical-examples and rh-ssg-gui-and-links take precedence.

# IBM Style Guide: Technical Elements review skill

Review documentation for technical element issues: code examples, command line, command syntax, files, keyboard keys, menus, UI elements, and web addresses.

**Precedence**: For Red Hat documentation, the Red Hat Supplementary Style Guide (SSG) takes precedence over IBM Style Guide rules. Where guidance conflicts, follow the RH SSG skill for that topic (e.g., `rh-ssg-technical-examples` for code blocks and IP addresses, `rh-ssg-gui-and-links` for UI elements).

## Checklist

### Code examples

- Code blocks use monospace formatting, not plain text or screenshots
- Examples are complete and runnable when possible
- Fenced code blocks specify the language: ```python, ```yaml, ```json
- Realistic variable names and values are used, not "foo," "bar," "baz"
- Example domains use RFC 2606: example.com
- Example IPs use RFC 5737: 192.0.2.x, 198.51.100.x, 203.0.113.x
- Placeholder values cannot be mistaken for real values

### Command line

- All commands are in monospace: `kubectl get pods`
- Command prompts indicate user type where relevant: `$` (user), `#` (root)
- Prompt characters are not included in copyable command blocks
- One command per line
- Long commands use backslash (\) for line continuation
- Command output is shown separately from the command

### Command syntax

- Syntax conventions are consistent:
  - `command` — literal text (monospace)
  - `<variable>` — required user-supplied values
  - `[optional]` — optional parameters
  - `{choice1 | choice2}` — mutually exclusive required choices
  - `...` — repeatable elements
- Every parameter is explained in a table or description list
- Syntax notation is not mixed within a document

### Commands

- Command names are in monospace: `grep`, `kubectl`, `docker`
- Lowercase command names are not capitalized
- Imperative mood is used: "Run the `deploy` command" not "The `deploy` command should be run"

### Files and directories

- File names and paths are in monospace: `config.yaml`, `/etc/hosts`
- Forward slashes (/) are used for paths in cross-platform docs
- "File name" is two words (not "filename")
- "Directory" or "folder" is used consistently (prefer "directory" in CLI contexts)
- File extensions are included: `README.md` not `README`

### Keyboard keys

- Key names are in bold: **Enter**, **Tab**, **Ctrl**
- Key combinations use plus with no spaces: **Ctrl+C**, **Cmd+Shift+P**
- Platform-appropriate modifier keys are specified: **Ctrl+S** (Windows/Linux) or **Cmd+S** (macOS)
- "Press" is used, not "hit" or "strike"
- Key names are capitalized: **Enter**, **Backspace**, **Escape**

### Menus and navigation

- Menu names and items are in bold: **File > Save As**
- ">" separates menu levels with spaces: **Edit > Preferences > General**
- "Click" is used for mouse actions; "select" or "choose" for menu items
- "Go to" is not used for menu navigation; "click" or "select" is used

### Mouse actions

- "Click" is used, not "click on," "single-click," or "left-click"
- "Right-click" is used only when the context menu is needed
- "Point to" or "rest the pointer on" is used, not "hover over"

### UI elements

- UI element names are in bold, matching exact on-screen text: **Submit**, **Cancel**
- UI capitalization matches the product exactly
- Element type is named when not obvious: "the **Name** field," "the **Advanced** tab"
- Quotation marks are not used around UI elements (bold is used)
- Correct interaction verbs are used:
  - **click** — buttons, links, checkboxes
  - **select** — menu items, dropdown options
  - **enter** or **type** — text fields
  - **clear** — checkboxes (to deselect)
  - **turn on/turn off** — toggles (not "enable/disable")

### Web, IP, and email addresses

- URLs and email addresses are in monospace: `https://example.com`
- HTTPS is used by default
- Example domains use RFC 2606; example IPs use RFC 5737; example IPv6 uses RFC 3849
- Real email addresses are not used in examples; `user@example.com` is used
- URLs include the protocol: `https://example.com` not `example.com`

## How to use

1. Review only changed content and necessary context
2. For each issue found, cite the relevant IBM Style Guide section
3. Mark issues as **required** (incorrect formatting, wrong syntax conventions) or **[SUGGESTION]** (preferences)

## Example invocations

- "Review this file for technical element formatting"
- "Check code examples and command syntax in this procedure"
- "Do an IBM technical elements review on modules/cli-reference.adoc"
