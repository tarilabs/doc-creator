Use this skill when checking grammar, word choice, inclusive language, or terminology compliance.

# IBM Style Guide: Language and Grammar review skill

Review documentation for language and grammar issues: abbreviations, capitalization, active voice, inclusive language, pronouns, contractions, and preferred terminology.

**Precedence**: For Red Hat documentation, the Red Hat Supplementary Style Guide (SSG) takes precedence over IBM Style Guide rules. Where guidance conflicts, follow the RH SSG skill for that topic (e.g., `rh-ssg-grammar-and-language` for conscious language and contractions).

## Checklist

### Abbreviations and acronyms

- Abbreviations are spelled out on first use: "command-line interface (CLI)"
- Well-known abbreviations (API, URL, HTML, PDF) are not unnecessarily spelled out
- No periods in abbreviations: US, UK, PhD, CEO
- Plural abbreviations have no apostrophe: APIs, URLs (not API's)
- Articles match the sound: "an SQL query," "a URL"
- Do NOT flag command names, utility names, tool names, or executable names as undefined acronyms — these are proper nouns or literal strings, not abbreviations (for example, `db2trc`, `ULOAD`, `SETUP`, `oc`, `kubectl`, `podman`)

### Capitalization

- Sentence case is used for headings, titles, labels, and buttons
- Generic technology terms are lowercase: cloud, server, database, container
- Product names follow official capitalization: GitHub, macOS, PostgreSQL, npm
- ALL CAPS is not used for emphasis

### Active voice and verbs

- Active voice is the default: "The system logs the event" not "The event is logged"
- Present tense is used: "creates" not "will create"
- Simple verb forms are preferred: "use" not "utilize," "start" not "initiate"
- Imperative mood is used for instructions
- Subjunctive mood is avoided ("should you want to..." > "if you want to...")

### Inclusive language

- "master/slave" is replaced with "primary/replica," "main/secondary," "leader/follower"
- "blacklist/whitelist" is replaced with "blocklist/allowlist"
- "sanity check" is replaced with "validity check," "confidence check"
- "guys," "manpower," "man-hours" are replaced with "team," "workforce," "person-hours"
- Gendered pronouns are not used for generic users; "they" or rewording is used
- Ableist language is avoided: "blind to," "cripple," "lame," "dumb"
- Person-first language is used: "people with disabilities" not "the disabled"

### Pronouns

- Second person "you" addresses the reader
- "They/them" is used as singular gender-neutral pronoun (not "he/she" or "s/he")
- "One" as a pronoun is avoided

### Contractions

- Contractions are used appropriately for the content type (informal: yes; formal: no)
- Informal contractions are never used: ain't, gonna, wanna

### Anthropomorphism

- Software is not given human qualities: "thinks," "wants," "knows," "believes"
- Software actions are described factually: "detects," "reports," "returns"

### Key terminology (preferred vs. avoid)

- "abort" > use "end," "cancel," "stop"
- "above/below" > use "previous/preceding," "following/later"
- "backend" > use "back end" (noun), "back-end" (adj)
- "click on" > use "click"
- "e.g." > use "for example"
- "etc." > use "and so on"
- "i.e." > use "that is"
- "impact" (verb) > use "affect"
- "in order to" > use "to"
- "leverage" (verb) > use "use"
- "may" > use "can" (ability) or "might" (possibility)
- "please" > omit in instructions
- "should" > use "must" (requirement) or "can" (suggestion)
- "simple/simply" > omit
- "utilize" > use "use"
- "via" > use "through," "by using"
- "whether or not" > use "whether"
