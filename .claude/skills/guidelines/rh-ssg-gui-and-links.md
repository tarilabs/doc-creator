description: Review Red Hat documentation for SSG graphical interface and link compliance — UI element formatting (bold text, correct verbs: click/select/enter), screenshot guidelines, text entry ("enter" not "type"), cross-reference format (xref), external link rules (no bare URLs, no shorteners, descriptive link text), Red Hat docs links (use "latest" in URL path), and Knowledgebase article link formatting. Use this skill when checking Red Hat docs for UI element formatting, link text, cross-references, screenshot usage, or URL formatting. Takes precedence over ibm-sg-technical-elements for UI and link checks on Red Hat content.

# Red Hat SSG: Graphical Interfaces and Links review skill

Review documentation for GUI and link compliance with the Red Hat Supplementary Style Guide.

## Checklist

### Screenshots

- Screenshots are avoided where possible (for accessibility and localization)
- If screenshots are used, alt text is unique and descriptive

### Text entry

- "Enter" is used (not "type" or "input") for user text entry
- The text to enter is in monospace: `In the *Name* field, enter \`test-postgresql\`.`

### User interface elements

- All GUI element names use bold text: `*Installed Operators*`
- Bold is used even for non-clickable elements if the name appears in the GUI
- Unlabeled elements use a generic description without bold: "the search field" not "the **Search** field"

### Interaction verbs

- "Click" is used, not "click on" — the word "on" is unnecessary
- "Select" or "choose" is used for menu items and dropdown options
- "Enter" is used for text fields (not "type" or "input")
- "Clear" is used to deselect a checkbox (not "uncheck" or "deselect")
- "Turn on" / "turn off" is used for toggles (not "enable" / "disable")

### Cross-references

- Cross-references are included only when necessary
- Critical information is included inline rather than cross-referenced
- Format: `For more information about <topic>, see xref:<link>[<link_text>].`

### External links

- Links to non-Red Hat/IBM sites are avoided unless necessary
- Links use top-level pages, not deep links (which break more frequently)
- No bare URLs — always include descriptive link text
- No URL shorteners
- Meaningful link text describes the target content (not "click here")
- `nofollow` link option is not used unless absolutely necessary

### Links to Red Hat documentation

- Red Hat docs links use `latest` in the URL path
- Format: `https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/.../latest/html/...`

### Links to Knowledgebase articles

- Link text uses the article title or descriptive running text
- In "Additional resources" sections: article title followed by `(Red Hat Knowledgebase)` within the link

## How to use

1. Review only changed content and necessary context
2. For each issue found, cite the relevant SSG section
3. Mark issues as **required** (bare URLs, missing alt text on screenshots) or **[SUGGESTION]** (improvements)

## Example invocations

- "Review UI elements and links in this module"
- "Check link formatting in assembly_getting-started.adoc"
- "Do an SSG GUI and links review on the changed files"
