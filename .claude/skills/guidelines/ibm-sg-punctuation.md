# IBM Style Guide: Punctuation review skill

Review documentation for punctuation issues: colons, commas, dashes, hyphens, parentheses, periods, quotation marks, semicolons, and slashes.

**Precedence**: For Red Hat documentation, the Red Hat Supplementary Style Guide (SSG) takes precedence over IBM Style Guide rules where guidance conflicts.

## Checklist

### Colons

- Colons introduce lists only after a complete sentence
  - Correct: "The tool supports three languages: Python, Go, and Java."
  - Wrong: "The tool supports: Python, Go, and Java."
- Text after a colon is not capitalized unless it begins a complete sentence or proper noun

### Commas

- Serial (Oxford) comma is used before "and"/"or" in lists of three or more
- Commas follow introductory phrases
- No comma before "that" in restrictive clauses
- Comma used before "which" in nonrestrictive clauses

### Dashes

- Em dashes (—) are used for emphasis or asides, with no spaces around them
- En dashes (–) are used for ranges: "pages 10–15"
- Hyphens (-) are not used where em dashes or en dashes belong
- No more than one pair of em dashes per sentence

### Ellipses

- Ellipses are not used to trail off or imply something
- Ellipses indicate omitted text in quotations or "more input needed" in UI only

### Exclamation points

- Exclamation points are not used in technical documentation
- Multiple exclamation points ("!!!") are never used

### Hyphens

- Compound adjectives are hyphenated before a noun: "command-line interface"
- Compound adjectives are not hyphenated after a noun: "the interface is command line"
- Adverb-adjective compounds with "-ly" are not hyphenated: "newly created file"
- Prefixes before proper nouns or numbers are hyphenated: "pre-2020," "non-IBM"
- Common prefixes are not hyphenated: reuse, coexist, noncompliant, preinstall, multicloud

### Parentheses

- Parentheses are used sparingly; important content is integrated into the sentence
- Parentheses are not nested
- Punctuation is placed outside parentheses (unless the entire sentence is parenthetical)

### Periods

- One space follows a period (not two)
- Periods end complete sentences in lists
- Periods are not used in headings, subheadings, or button labels
- List items are consistent: all periods or no periods, not mixed

### Quotation marks

- Double quotation marks are used for direct quotes and titles
- Commas and periods are placed inside quotation marks (US style)
- Colons and semicolons are placed outside quotation marks
- Quotation marks are not used for emphasis (use bold or italic)
- Code terms use monospace formatting, not quotation marks

### Semicolons

- Semicolons are avoided; sentences are split instead
- Semicolons are used only in complex lists where items contain commas

### Slashes

- Slashes for "or" are avoided; "or" is written out: "Linux or macOS" not "Linux/macOS"
- "and/or" is not used; "and," "or," or rephrasing is preferred
- Slashes are acceptable in established terms: "client/server," "TCP/IP," "I/O"

## How to use

1. Review only changed content and necessary context
2. For each issue found, cite the relevant IBM Style Guide section
3. Mark issues as **required** (incorrect punctuation) or **[SUGGESTION]** (style preferences)

## Example invocations

- "Review this file for punctuation issues"
- "Check comma and hyphen usage in this module"
- "Do an IBM punctuation review on the changed files"
