description: Review Red Hat documentation for SSG technical example compliance — root privilege commands (use sudo with $ prompt, not su -), YAML ellipses (use "# ..." not bare "..."), IP addresses (RFC 5737 for IPv4, RFC 3849 for IPv6), MAC addresses (RFC 7042), code block quality (accurate, copy-paste friendly), and syntax highlighting (never use "bash" for terminal commands — use "terminal", "console", or omit). Use this skill when checking Red Hat docs for code examples, IP/MAC addresses in examples, sudo usage, YAML formatting, or source language tags on code blocks. Takes precedence over ibm-sg-technical-elements for Red Hat content.

# Red Hat SSG: Technical Examples review skill

Review documentation for technical example compliance with the Red Hat Supplementary Style Guide.

## Checklist

### Commands requiring root privileges

- Commands requiring root privileges use `sudo` prefix, not `su -`
- Commands with `sudo` use the `$` prompt, not `#`
- Shell prompts alone are not the only indicator of required privilege level — step text, intro, or prerequisites also state the requirement
- If multiple commands require root, introductory text mentions it: "Some tasks in this procedure require root privileges..."

### Ellipses in YAML code blocks

- Ellipses in YAML use `# ...` (commented out), not bare `...`
- Bare `...` in YAML is reserved for "end of document" per YAML spec

### IP addresses and MAC addresses

- Example IPv4 addresses use RFC 5737 reserved ranges:
  - `192.0.2.0/24`
  - `198.51.100.0/24`
  - `203.0.113.0/24`
- Example IPv6 addresses use RFC 3849 reserved range: `2001:0DB8::/32`
- Example MAC addresses use RFC 7042 reserved ranges:
  - Unicast: `00:00:5E:00:53:00` – `00:00:5E:00:53:FF`
  - Multicast: `01:00:5E:90:10:00` – `01:00:5E:90:10:FF`
- No real IP or MAC addresses are used in examples

### Long code examples

- All code blocks are necessary, accurate, and helpful
- Code blocks are copy-and-paste friendly (except for user-replaced values)

### Syntax highlighting

- Source language is provided when supported: `[source,yaml]`, `[source,xml]`, etc.
- `bash` is NOT used for terminal commands — it misinterprets `#` as a comment instead of a root prompt
- Use `terminal` or `console` or omit the source language for shell commands

## How to use

1. Review only changed content and necessary context
2. For each issue found, cite the relevant SSG section
3. Mark issues as **required** (real IP addresses, `bash` source language for shell commands) or **[SUGGESTION]** (improvements)

## Example invocations

- "Review technical examples in this procedure module"
- "Check IP addresses and code blocks in proc_configuring-network.adoc"
- "Do an SSG technical examples review on the changed files"
